<h1>Personalized Japanese Coaching with Josh</h1>
<p>
    ðŸ‡¯ðŸ‡µ When I was learning Japanese, I spent a lot of time figuring out what actually worked. I tried different study methods,
    struggled with speaking confidently, and learned through trial and error. Looking back, I would have loved to have
    someone to talk things through withâ€”a way to make the process feel clearer and more structured.
</p>
<p>
    ðŸŒ± If you're feeling stuck, or just want some guidance on where to focus next, I can help. Whether it's <strong>building a study habit</strong>,
    <strong>practicing real conversations</strong>, or <strong>figuring out the next step</strong> in your journey, we can work through it together in a way that
    makes sense for you.
</p>
<p>
    ðŸ’¡ My goal is to make learning feel approachable, sustainable, and enjoyableâ€”not overwhelming. If that sounds like
    something you'd find helpful, let's chat.
